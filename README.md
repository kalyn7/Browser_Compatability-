# Browser_Compatability-
Browsers basically work on different Websites, but I'm trying to check compatability of different browsers for same website to check their performance.
Tools: Selenium 2.4.7, TestNG testing suite for annotations and parallel testing, Chrome Driver, Firefox Driver, IE driver.
I have developed a code which can take automatic screenshots of a yahoo mail website.
In this 3 steps done by user are notified by taking screenshots automatically when he moves to next step.
Screenshots are saved by giving a parameter of execution time, so we can come over the over writing problems.
Every browser has its own compatability with particular website, in this code I have noticed that Crome is working faster than Firefox for yahoo.
